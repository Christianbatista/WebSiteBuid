				<p> There has always been one question that's guided my career and excited my curiosity and that is <strong> "how does this thing work?".</strong></p>
				
				<p> I'm a Project Management Professtional based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_South_Carolina" target="_blank">Lexingtion,SC</a>. 
					My experiance has been in healthcare reform, information technology implementations, financial data analyst, and general management. Opportunities to learn something new arise every day and itâ€™s our 
					responsibility to take advantage of these daily gifts to progress.
				</p>
				<p>	When begining any new project or task it all starts with having the proper strategy, drawn in advance. This can favorably impact project execution and set the correct expectations 
					early on by letting you and your team know what the important strategic direction is. So how do we take this first step you ask? Its by really understanding our 
					customer's needs before trying to help them. Before you can even build the solution you need to know why you're building it, who will be using it and when they will 
					and for what purpose will it be used for. The goal is always to create longer-term trust with my clients and my team to reach to end goal successfully.
				</p>

				<p><em>"You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with 
				a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand."</em></p>
