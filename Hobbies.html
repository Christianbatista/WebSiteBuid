			<p>Jiu-Jitsu is a mental game as much as a physical one that requires calm and constant thinking. I apply many of its teachings not only to my life but also my career. You must practice a form of constant visualization 
				going over the different outcomes that can occur just like in project management. The only way you can truly master Jiu-Jitsu is only through failing. As Miyamoto Musashi the Japanese philosopher said "The way of the warrior is resolute acceptance of falling"
				This beautiful art teaches many life lessons about patience and embracing change. When rolling on the ground with your opponent you must learn to 
				use his or her leverage against them and roll freely. Bruce Lee once said “Notice that the stiffest tree is most easily cracked, while the bamboo or willow survives by bending with the wind.” 
				This is by far the most important characteristic of jiu-jitsu and one of the most overlooked and hardest aspects of the art to overcome. </p>
	
			<p>I hope you this inspires you to try Jiu-Jitsu one day</p>
